Basic MySQL Questions
What is MySQL?

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage and query data.
What is the difference between MySQL and SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language for querying and managing databases, while MySQL is an RDBMS that uses SQL to interact with data.
What are the different types of JOINs in MySQL?

INNER JOIN: Returns only the rows with matching values in both tables.
LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
FULL JOIN: Returns all rows when there is a match in either the left or right table.
What is a primary key?

A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table. It must contain unique values, and no NULL values are allowed.
What is a foreign key?

A foreign key is a field in one table that uniquely identifies a row in another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables.
What are indexes in MySQL?

Indexes are used to speed up the retrieval of rows from a database. An index is a data structure that improves query performance but can slow down insert, update, and delete operations.
What are the different types of indexes in MySQL?

Unique Index: Ensures that all values in the indexed column(s) are unique.
Primary Index: A unique index that also serves as the primary key.
Full-text Index: Optimizes text searching.
Composite Index: An index on multiple columns.
Intermediate MySQL Questions
What is normalization in MySQL?

Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and dependency. It involves dividing a database into tables and creating relationships between them. The goal is to make the database more efficient and easier to maintain.
What are the different normal forms in MySQL?

1st Normal Form (1NF): Ensures that all columns contain atomic (indivisible) values.
2nd Normal Form (2NF): Ensures that the database is in 1NF and that all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key.
3rd Normal Form (3NF): Ensures that the database is in 2NF and that all attributes are non-transitively dependent on the primary key.
What is a subquery in MySQL?

A subquery is a query nested inside another query. It can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.
What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses?

WHERE: Filters rows before aggregation (used with SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE).
HAVING: Filters groups after aggregation (used with GROUP BY).
What is a transaction in MySQL?

A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations that are executed as a single unit. Transactions ensure data integrity by following ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
What are the ACID properties of a transaction?

Atomicity: All operations in a transaction are completed, or none are.
Consistency: The database moves from one valid state to another.
Isolation: Transactions are isolated from one another.
Durability: Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent.
What are the different isolation levels in MySQL?

Read Uncommitted: Transactions can read uncommitted data from other transactions.
Read Committed: Transactions can only read committed data.
Repeatable Read: Ensures that if a transaction reads a value, it will get the same value on subsequent reads.
Serializable: The highest isolation level, where transactions are executed serially.
Advanced MySQL Questions
What is the difference between TRUNCATE and DELETE?

TRUNCATE: Removes all rows from a table, but the table structure remains. Itâ€™s faster than DELETE and does not log individual row deletions.
DELETE: Removes rows from a table one at a time and logs the deletion. It can be used with a WHERE clause to delete specific rows.
What is a view in MySQL?

A view is a virtual table based on the result of a SELECT query. It does not store data itself but shows data from one or more tables.
What is a stored procedure in MySQL?

A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit. It is stored in the database and can be reused.
What is a trigger in MySQL?

A trigger is a stored procedure that is automatically executed when certain events (such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) occur on a specified table.
What is the EXPLAIN statement in MySQL?

The EXPLAIN statement provides information about how MySQL executes a query, showing details about the query execution plan (such as table scans, indexes used, and join types).
What is a MySQL join optimization?

Optimize JOINs by:
Ensuring proper indexes on columns used in JOINs.
Reducing the number of records processed (e.g., filtering with WHERE before JOIN).
Using appropriate JOIN types based on query requirements.
What is replication in MySQL?

Replication in MySQL is the process of copying data from one server (master) to another (slave). It is used for scaling, backup, and redundancy.
What is sharding in MySQL?

Sharding is the process of splitting data into smaller, more manageable parts (shards), which can be stored on separate servers. This helps improve scalability and performance for large databases.
What is the difference between MyISAM and InnoDB storage engines?

MyISAM: Non-transactional, faster for read-heavy applications, does not support foreign keys.
InnoDB: Transactional, supports ACID properties, foreign keys, and better for write-heavy applications.
What is a deadlock in MySQL? How can you prevent it?

A deadlock occurs when two or more transactions are blocked, each waiting for the other to release a lock. To prevent deadlocks:
Access tables in the same order in all transactions.
Use shorter transactions.
Implement proper indexing.
Performance Tuning and Optimization
How can you optimize a slow MySQL query?

Use the EXPLAIN statement to analyze the query execution plan.
Index the columns involved in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses.
Avoid using SELECT *; select only necessary columns.
Consider query caching, partitioning large tables, or denormalization.
What are partitioned tables in MySQL?

Partitioning is dividing large tables into smaller, more manageable pieces. Each partition can be stored on a different file or disk, improving query performance.
How do you handle large datasets in MySQL?

Use indexing, partitioning, query optimization, and caching to manage large datasets efficiently.
What is query optimization in MySQL?

Query optimization involves writing efficient SQL queries, using appropriate indexes, minimizing nested subqueries, and reducing the number of rows processed.
